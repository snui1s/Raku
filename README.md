# 楽 Raku

### Lightning Fast. Dead Simple. Just Write.

<p>
    A blazing-fast, distraction-free note-taking app.<br>
    No accounts. No cloud. No friction. <strong>Just you and your thoughts.</strong>
</p>
<p>
    The name also captures the spirit of <em>"Rakugaki" (落書き)</em>, meaning "Scribble".<br>
    It celebrates the messy, raw, and unpolished nature of your initial thoughts.<br>
    <strong>Capture now, organize later.</strong>
</p>
